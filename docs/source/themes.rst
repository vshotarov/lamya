Themes
======
Themes are an integral part of any static site generation framework and as such
pygeon has a framework for customizing themes via the
:ref:`theme options<cli_reference_theme-options>` arguments,
but other than pygeon tries to stay away from the theme as much as possible, as
that aspect is very specific to the site itself.

- :doc:`theme-framework` - a description of how themes are expected to work and
  what customization options are available
- :doc:`default-theme` - a description of the supported theme options for the
  default pygeon theme
