I am Vasil Shotarov. Currently I live in London, enjoying the beautiful weather and rigging for Blue Zoo. Previously, I studied computer animation at Bournemouth University.

I have recently started [bindpose](https://bindpose.com) - a blog about rigging in Maya, mainly with Python. On there, I share tips, ideas and code about improving as a rigger.
