# Notes
- at the moment rebuliding the website deletes the whole `build` folder and recreates it from scratch, which can become quite slow on huge websites, so i need some sort of a smart rebuild.

# Todos
- make a demo website for the default theme
- add install instructions after this is deployed
- add rss
- properly structure the `__init__.py`
