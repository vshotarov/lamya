# Notes and Todos
- I am not keen on the name `build` for the output folder
- I would like to make the code treat all content the same way, i.e. the page containing all the blog posts (presumably `http://url.xyz/blog`) exactly the same as say the about page. So, static individual pages are the same thing as aggregated ones. Writing this makes me feel this is an unnecessary generalization but let's see how it goes.

# Acknowledgements
- I used [The excellent lorem ipsum markdown generator by Jasper Van der Jeugt](https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/) to generate some example markdown for the unit tests
