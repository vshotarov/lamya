# Notes
- I am not keen on the name `build` for the output folder

# Todos
- add a way of aggregating all descendents into the home page rather than just the direct ones
- add install instructions after this is deployed
- add code highlighting
- document `pyg_urlencode` for theme developers
- document the required/supported front matter info for the default theme
- add rss
- properly structure the `__init__.py`
- at the moment rebuliding the website deletes the whole `build` folder and recreates it from scratch, which can become quite slow on huge websites, so i need some sort of a smart rebuild.
